# Changelog

All notable changes to Animicro are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.7] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- **Data attributes** renamed to namespaced `data-am-*` format:
  - `data-duration` → `data-am-duration`
  - `data-delay` → `data-am-delay`
  - `data-easing` → `data-am-easing`
  - `data-margin` → `data-am-margin`
  - `data-distance` → `data-am-distance`
  - `data-scale` → `data-am-scale`
  - `data-blur` → `data-am-blur`
  - `data-stagger` → `data-am-stagger`
  - `data-speed` → `data-am-speed`
  - `data-split` → `data-am-split`
- Avoids conflicts with other plugins; aligns with `.am-*` class naming

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Reset to default** button in Fade preview panel to restore duration, easing, delay, and margin
- Plugin row links: **Settings** (to admin) and **Upgrade to Pro** (bold green, animicro.com)

### Changed

- **Cheat Sheet** is Pro-only: tab shows "Pro" badge and is locked without license; content visible only for Pro users
- Examples section removed from Cheat Sheet (CSS Classes and Data Attributes tables only)
- Plugin URI and Author URI set to https://animicro.com

## [0.2.5] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Live preview** for Fade module settings: animated square on the right that reflects duration, easing, and delay in real time
- **Replay** button to manually trigger the preview animation

### Changed

- **Builder selection** is now multiselect: you can enable multiple builders (e.g. Bricks + Elementor) at once
- Fade settings field order: Delay moved to second position (after Duration)
- Preview panel background: light gray instead of dark
- Preview no longer loops automatically; use Replay to see the animation again

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Bricks Builder integration**: elements with animation classes stay visible in the editor and animations only run on the live frontend
- **Builder-specific CSS strategy**: dynamic inline CSS in `<head>` uses `body:not(.editor-class)` per builder for zero-flicker loading
- `will-change` optimization on all animation modules for GPU-accelerated rendering

### Changed

- Dynamic CSS now prints at priority 5 in `wp_head` for faster rendering
- Simplified JS builder detection: only checks `?bricks=run` URL parameter
- All UI strings translated to English for international distribution

### Fixed

- Elements with `.am-fade` no longer disappear inside the Bricks editor
- Animations no longer execute inside builder preview/canvas

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Animation engine** powered by Motion One with 8 modules:
  - **Free**: Fade, Slide Up, Slide Down, Scale
  - **Pro**: Blur, Stagger, Parallax, Split Text
- **Admin panel** React with tabs: Modules, Cheat Sheet, Integrations
- **Per-module settings**: individual configuration (duration, easing, delay, margin) for Fade
- **Pro license system** integrated with Supabase:
  - "License" submenu to activate/deactivate license
  - Periodic validation every 24 hours
  - Pro modules locked without active license
- **Universal CSS** for builder compatibility (Elementor, Bricks, Oxygen, Breakdance)
- **Accessibility fallback** (`@media (scripting: none)`) for users without JavaScript
- **Code splitting** on frontend: only loads JS of active modules
- **Data attributes**: `data-am-duration`, `data-am-delay`, `data-am-easing`, `data-am-margin` per element

### Technical

- PHP 7.4+, WordPress 6.0+
- Vite 6 for admin (React + TypeScript + Tailwind) and frontend (Vanilla JS) build
- REST API: `animicro/v1/settings`, `animicro/v1/license/status`, `animicro/v1/license/save`
